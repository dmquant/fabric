# Fabric Monorepo

This repository will host multiple AI-driven applications that share a common backend. The Cloudflare Worker backend lives in `worker/`.

## Layout
- `worker/` â€” Cloudflare Worker project that exposes the Fabric APIs (sessions, logs, assets).

See `worker/README.md` for setup, deployment, and API documentation.
